  <h1>Federalists, a Stronger Union, and the Ratification Fight (1787–1790)</h1>
  <div class="subtitle">A print‑friendly timeline with key players, underhanded political maneuvering, Anti‑Federalist responses, and citations.</div>

  <p class="lede">
  This report documents how prominent Federalists advocated a <strong>strong central government</strong> and, according to contemporary critics,
  used <strong>underhanded political maneuvering</strong> to secure ratification — paired with Anti‑Federalist responses and outcomes. Hamilton
  and Franklin are highlighted among other key figures. Endnotes identify primary sources (Farrand, ConSource, Avalon, Founders Online, TAH, NCC, Senate Historical Office).
